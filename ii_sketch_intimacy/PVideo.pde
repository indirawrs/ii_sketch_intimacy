/*

IGNORE, this was going to be used for the purpose stated below, but there's an error loading the videos here so 
i deleted the changes made to this code and subsequently will never use this. but this is the barebones stuff in case u wanna know
where my head was at. thxx

The purpose of this applet is to project the videos separately from the dat


class PVideo extends PApplet {
  PVideo() {
    super();
    PApplet.runSketch(new String[] {this.getClass().getSimpleName()}, this);
  }

  void settings() {
    size(500, 200);
  }

  void setup() {
    background(255, 0, 0);
  }

  void draw() {
  }
}
